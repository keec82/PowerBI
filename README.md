This small PowerBI project works on Professional Survey data (file attached). While there's plenty of ways to play with the data, 
I decided to focus on specific points such as salaries by job title, hapinesss index, and data science-related questions. 

To begin with, there was a little Data Transofrmation involved such as removing certain unwanted columns and creating columns based on 
in-built formulas. After that, I used PowerBI Report View to work on the above points.
