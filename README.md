Hello everyone!

Keegan here.
I've been coding for a year or so now and have dabbled in MATLAB, Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI applications. 
All work in my repositories basically reflect my learning pathway, as I'm looking to hone my skills in data analsysi/engineering. 

Feel free to use my work as reference and let's learn together.


Keegan
